**Machine Learning Course Assignments**

This repository contains my homework assignments from the *Machine Learning* course at the *University of Haifa*.  
Each assignment was implemented in *Python (Jupyter Notebooks)* and focuses on core *machine learning algorithms* and *data analysis techniques*.

## Contents  

**[HW1 – Bayesian Models & kNN]**  
- Built and evaluated **Gaussian Bayes**, **Naive Bayes**, and **k-Nearest Neighbors** classifiers.  
- Applied models on structured data, text classification, and image data.  
- Explored feature selection, distance metrics, and decision boundaries.


**[HW2 – Classification Algorithms & Kernel Methods]**  
- Built custom implementations of **Logistic Regression**, **Perceptron**, and **SVM** for both structured and textual data.  
- Applied **Word2Vec embeddings** for sentiment classification of IMDB movie reviews.  
- Explored **kernel functions**, **feature mapping**, and **hyperparameter tuning** for SVM models.  
- Compared different models in terms of accuracy, convergence, and generalization.

  
**[HW3 – Multiclass SVM, Regression, and Decision Trees]**  
- Implemented **One-vs-One SVM classifier** and analyzed the effect of the regularization parameter `C` on train/test performance.  
- Built a **softmax-based neural network** using PyTorch for classification and evaluated its behavior under different epochs and batch sizes.  
- Solved **Linear Regression** using both closed-form and **Gradient Descent** methods; explored convergence rate and impact of correlated features.  
- Applied **Ridge Regression**, examining the trade-off between regularization and model complexity.  
- Built a custom **Decision Tree classifier**, including entropy and information gain calculations, with analysis of overfitting and optimal tree depth using **K-Fold Cross-Validation**.

  

**[HW4 – Ensemble Learning, Dimensionality Reduction & Clustering]**  
- Implemented **bagging** with linear and ridge regression.  
- Applied **K-means clustering** for data segmentation and image compression.  
- Used **PCA, LDA, and Kernel PCA** for dimensionality reduction and improved KNN classification accuracy on image-based datasets.
